1. weak 
	but watch
2. bad
	very woke
	all woke boxes were checked
	a former bully who becomes decent was not forgiven
	a boy who did something very wrong in the first season is obviously 1) still in love
	with the main actor and 2) is having some major issues in his personal life..
	then he wants to apologise .. but is not given any chance
	IMHO the bullied became cruel and bullies themselves.
